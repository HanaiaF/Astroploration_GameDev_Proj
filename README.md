# Astroploration_GameDev_Proj
We built an educational, fun, and immersive game that enables the player to explore a spaceship as an astronaut and tackle challenges like using a spectrometer to analyze composition of rock samples with the goal of determining their planet of origin.
Join us on a journey to space where you will tackle challenges to explore our solar system!
